# Technical Plan

Pages to be created:
1. Product Page
2. Results Page


Data to save: 
1. 3 product objects that will be randomly displayed after each vote
2. Items voted on
3. How many times an item was voted for
4. How many times each each product was viewed


Variables used/tracked: 
1. The images
2. The number of votes
3. The number of image views
4. 25 total votes
5. The radio button


Rules/Algorithms: 
1. Products are going to need to be randomized and displayed differently from the previous vote on each click
2. The splice method will allow the original object to be duplicated uniquely to preserve state.
3. Display a chart of the total total votes and number of views of the item
4.
